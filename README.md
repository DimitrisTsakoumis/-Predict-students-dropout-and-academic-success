# -Predict-students-dropout-and-academic-success
This challenge aims to address the issue of identifying students who are at risk of
dropping out of school or struggling academically. This problem is significant as dropout
rates can have detrimental effects on individuals' future prospects and can contribute to
broader societal challenges such as unemployment and poverty. By leveraging AI and
machine learning techniques, participants in the hackathon can work to develop
predictive models that can analyse various factors such as attendance, grades, socioeconomic background behavioral patterns, etc., to accurately forecast which students
are likely to drop out or face academic difficulties, or that are in the way towards
academic success.
